          Saint John's High School has created <b>multiple plans</b> for our
          return to learning, most of them involving a return to campus.
          Unfortunately, while the school has gauged the opinions of parents
          about our return, three problems still exist:
        </Text>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The plans themselves have not been shared with families nor
            students.
          </li>
          <li>
            The last update to parents was released almost <b>a month ago.</b>
          </li>
          <li>Student opinion has not been received nor recorded.</li>
        </ul>
        <Text>
          So let's <b>change that</b>. Let's make our voices heard. School is
          only a few weeks away so we have only <b>a few days</b> to make sure
          we get a say, so please respond ASAP.

          We've created a list of statements to poll your opinion on the
          school's plan. All you need to do is answer them <b>honestly</b>.
          We'll compile the results of this poll into our letter to the
          administration. It should take under 2 minutes.

          If you have time, we'd really appreciate any extended thoughts that
          you have on SJ's plan. Two sentences, an essay â€” all totally fine.
          Portions of these will compose the large majority of our letter to the
          administration.
